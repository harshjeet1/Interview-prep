Using the bank_transactions table, find how many users made at least one transaction each day in the first five days of January 2020.

with cte as
(select user_id, count(distinct day (created_at)) as num_days
from bank_transactions
where created_at between '2020-01-01' and '2020-01-06'
group by 1)
select count(distinct user_id) as number_of_users
from cte where num_days =5

/*Top 5 Turnover Risk*/
Q.Given two tables, employees and projects, find the five lowest-paid employees who have completed at least three projects.
Note: We consider projects to be completed when they have an end date, which is the same as saying their End_dt is not NULL.

with cte as
(select employee_id, salary, rank() over(order by salary) as rnk
from employees e
join projects  p on e.id = p.employee_id
where end_dt is not null
group by id
having count(project_id) >= 3)
select employee_id from cte

/*Average Commute Time*/
Q.Write a query to get the average commute time (in minutes) for each commuter in New York (NY) and the average commute time (in minutes) across all commuters in New York.

WITH CTE AS
(SELECT commuter_id,
    FLOOR(AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE,start_dt,end_dt))) AS avg_commuter_time	
    FROM rides
WHERE city = 'NY'
GROUP BY 1),
CTE1 AS(
    SELECT FLOOR(AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE,start_dt,end_dt))) AS avg_time
    FROM rides
    WHERE city = 'NY'
)
SELECT * FROM CTE,CTE1
